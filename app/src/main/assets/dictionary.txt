Absolute zero-The temperature where all movement stops even on a molecular level, it is also lowest temperature on the Kelvin scale. \n\nOther Definition: The zero point on the absolute temperature scale; -273.15 degree C or 0 K; theoretically, the temperature at which molecular motion ceases. \n\nOther Definition: 0 K or -273.15degree C.  This is the temperature at which molecular motion is at a minimum. \n\nOther Definition: This is the lowest value on any temperature scale. On the Kelvin scale, it is the zero point, and on Celsius scale it is -273.15 degrees. It is the lowest temperature at which the kinetic energy of the atoms and molecules becomes minimum. Absolute temperature can be attained theoretically only. It is not possible to achieve the temperature by any artificial or natural means. \n\nOther Definition: the temperature at which all possible heat has been removed from an object. \n\nOther Definition: Absolute zero is theoretically, the lowest attainable temperature.

Acceleration-Measure of how fast velocity is changing, so we can think of it as the change in velocity over change in time. The most common use of acceleration is acceleration due to gravity, which can also appear as the gravitational constant (9.8 m/s[2]). \n\nOther Definition: If a point-like object undergoes a change in velocity Δv=v(f)-v(i) in time Δt=t(f)-t(i) (indexes i and f stand for initial and final instant as well as for initial and final velocity) its average acceleration, a is defined as\na(->) =  Δv(->) / Δ t\nThe instantaneous acceleration, a, is obtained from the average acceleration by shrinking the time interval Δt towards zero. The average acceleration approaches a limiting value, which is the acceleration of a given instant:\na(->) = lim Δ t->0\nΔv(->) / Δ t\nAcceleration is a vector quantity. SI unit for acceleration is m s[-2].
Accuracy-How closely a measured value agrees with the correct value. \n\nOther Definition: How close a particular measurement is to the true value.
Acheson process-Acheson process is an industrial process to synthesize graphite and silicon carbide (carborundum), named after its inventor the American chemist Edward Goodrich Acheson (1856-1931). In this process, a solid-state reaction between pure silica sand (SiO(2)) and petroleum coke (C) at very high temperature (more than 2500 °C) leads to the formation of silicon carbide under the general reaction:\nSiO(2)(s) + 3C(s)<=>SiC(s) + 2CO(2)(g)\nWhile studying the effects of high temperature on carborundum, Acheson had found that silicon vaporizes at about 4150 °C, leaving behind graphitic carbon.
Achiral-Describes any molecule or object that is superimposable upon its mirror image. \n\nOther Definition: not chiral. A compound (or object) that is superimposible on its mirror image. For example CH(4).
Acid-A substance that produces H+(aq) ions in aqueous solution.  Strong acids ionize completely or almost completely in dilute aqueous solution.  Weak acids ionize only slightly. \n\nOther Definition: A liquid with a pH less than seven. \n\nOther Definition: A chemical that can act as a proton donor (Bronsted-Lowry theory) or is an electron acceptor (Lewis theory). \n\nOther Definition: An acid is a chemical substance which has a tendency to release Hydrogen ions or protons, and accept electrons. In an aqueous state, an acid readily produces a large amount of H+ (aq) ions. Most of the strong acids get ionized almost completely in the dilute aqueous solution, whereas, the ones that are weak acids, ionize partially. \n\nOther Definition: an agent able to produce positively charged hydrogen ions (H[+]). [Since the hydrogen ion is a bare proton, it usually exists in a solvated form (such as H(3)O[+]).]. \n\nOther Definition: a compound that donates a hydrogen ion (H[+]) to another compound. \n\nOther Definition: Acid is a type of compound that contains hydrogen and dissociates in water to produce positive hydrogen ions. The reaction for an acid HA is commonly written:\nHA<=>H[+] + A[-]\nIn fact, the hydrogen ion (the proton) is solvated, and the complete reaction is:\nHA + H(2)O<=>H(3)O[+] + A[-]\nThis definition of acids comes from the Arrhenius theory. Such acids tend to be corrosive substances with a sharp taste, which turn litmus red and produce colour changes with other indicators. They are referred to as protonic acids and are classified into strong acids, which are almost completely dissociated in water, (e.g. sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid), and weak acids, which are only partially dissociated (e.g. acetic acid and hydrogen sulphide). The strength of an acid depends on the extent to which it dissociates, and is measured by its dissociation constant.\nIn the Lowry-Brønsted theory of acids and bases (1923), the definition was extended to one in which an acid is a proton donor (a Brønsted acid), and a base is a proton acceptor (a Brønsted base). An important feature of the Lowry-Brønsted concept is that when an acid gives up a proton, a conjugate base is formed that is capable of accepting a proton.\nacid<=>base + H[+]\nSimilarly, every base produces its conjugate acid as a result of accepting a proton.\nbase + H[+]<=>acid\nFor example, acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, and ammonium ion is the conjugate acid of ammonia.\nAs the acid of a conjugate acid/base pair becomes weaker, its conjugate base becomes stronger and vice versa.\nA further extension of the idea of acids and bases was made in the Lewis theory. In this, a G. N. Lewis acid is a compound or atom that can accept a pair of electrons and a Lewis base is one that can donate an electron pair. This definition encompasses 'traditional' acid-base reactions, but it also includes reactions that do not involve ions, e.g.\nH(3)N: BCl(3) -> H(3)NBCl(3)\nin which NH(3) is the base (donor) and BCl(3) the acid (acceptor).

Actinide-Element in the 2nd row of the f-block elements.
Actinides-Elements 90 to 103 (after  actinium). \n\nOther Definition: The row of elements below the periodic table, from thorium to lawrencium. \n\nOther Definition: Actinides (actinons or actinoids) are the fourteen elements from thorium to lawrencium inclusive, which follow actinium in the periodic table. The position of actinium is somewhat equivocal and, although not itself an actinide, it is often included with them for comparative purpose. The series includes the following elements: thorium (Th), protactinium (Pa), uranium (U), neptunium (Np), plutonium (Pu), amercium (Am), curium (Cm), berkelium (Bk), californium (Cf), einsteinium (Es), fermium (Fm), mendelevium (Md), nobelium (No) and lawrencium (Lr). Every known isotope of the actinide elements is radioactive. Traces of Pa, Np and Pu are consequently found, but only Th and U occur naturally to any useful extent.

The origin of the name comes from the Greek word aktinos meaning ray. It is heavy, silvery-white, very radioactive metal. Reacts with water. Glows in the dark. Actinium is extremely rare, found in all uranium ores. Usually obtained by treating radium with neutrons in a reactor.

It is useful for removing toxic substances from air, and water. \n\nOther Definition: Activated charcoal or activated carbon is charcoal that has been activated for adsorption by steaming or by heating in a vacuum. Charcoal is obtained by burning wood, nutshells, coconut husks or other materials. Charcoal becomes activated by heating it with steam to approximately 1000 °C in the absence of oxygen.\nThe chemical nature of amorphous carbon, combined with a high surface area makes it an ideal medium for the adsorption of organic chemicals. A single gram of such material can have 400 m[2] to 1 200 m[2] square meters of surface area. Activated charcoal is widely used to decolorize liquids, recover solvents, and remove toxins from water and air.

Activation Energy-Amount of energy that must be absorbed by reactants in their ground states to reach the transition state so that a reaction can occur. \n\nOther Definition: During a chemical reaction, the minimum amount of energy which is needed by the reactants to get converted into products is known as activation energy. \n\nOther Definition: the miminmum energy which reacting species must possess in order to be able to form an 'activated complex', or 'transition state', before proceeding to the products. [The activation energy (Ea) may be derived from the temperature dependence of the reaction rate using the Arrhenius equation.]. \n\nOther Definition: the minimum energy necessary to form an activated complex in a reaction. \n\nOther Definition: Activation energy (E(a)) is the energy that must be added to a system in order for a process to occur, even though the process may already be thermodynamically possible. In chemical kinetics, the activation energy is the height of the potential barrier separating the products and reactants. It determines the temperature dependence on the reaction rate.
